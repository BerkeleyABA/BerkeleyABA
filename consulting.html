                    <p class="quote">Venmo Marketing had the pleasure of working with the ABA Marketing team in 2017 - the team was passionate, vibrant and committed throughout the whole experience. The teams energy was infectious as they lived and breathed the Venmo brand and provided great insights through the college student research prompt and rich competitive analysis. Every presentation was delivered at an exceptionally high standard and the final prompt blew our team away as they went above and beyond delivering fresh new ideas that addressed customer pain points.</p>

It was such a pleasure to learn from intelligent young minds about ways we could improve our marketing initiatives. They brought some amazing ideas to the table that we had never considered, presented them with the utmost professionalism and based every recommendation off of data and research.

The entire group was very professional and responsive almost as if they were working on the project full time. What was most helpful was how flexible they were to feedback. All put together, the ABA team's time working with us delivered results that were either a fresh perspective for the entire product team or reinforced some of our intuitions. Great job!</p>
